# Q-Learning-and-Deep-Q-Network
In this project, we will implement Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms to optimize the behavior of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent applied to a maze pathfinding problem. Our task includes designing and tuning these algorithms to enable effective agent navigation.
